# Java Async Programming Timeline: From Threads to Reactive Streams

---

### 🧵 1. Classic Threads (Pre-Java 5) — _“The Wild West”_

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // do blocking work
    System.out.println("Doing work");
});
thread.start();
```

🧠 **Problem**: Every task creates a new thread — eats RAM, poor scaling, and prone to bugs (race conditions, deadlocks).

---

### 🧵 2. ExecutorService (Java 5) — _“A Little Order”_

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> {
    // still blocking, but managed
});
```

🧠 **Improvement**: Thread pooling! But still **blocking** under the hood. Still tied to the thread-per-task model.

---

### 🔮 3. Future<T> (Java 5) — _“Async... But Not Really”_

```java
Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return "Done";
});
String result = future.get(); // blocks!
```

🧠 **Problem**: You *can* submit tasks, but `.get()` is blocking. There’s no easy way to chain tasks or handle errors elegantly.

---

### 🤯 4. CompletableFuture<T> (Java 8) — _“We’re Getting There!”_

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "One")
    .thenApply(result -> result + " Two")
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

🧠 **Huge win**:
- Non-blocking
- Task chaining
- Exception handling with `.exceptionally()`
- Parallelizing with `.thenCombine()` or `.allOf()`

BUT:
- Not integrated into Spring MVC well
- No backpressure
- Still lacks deep reactive stream capabilities

---

### ⚡ 5. Project Reactor: Mono & Flux (Spring 5+) — _“Fully Reactive”_

```java
Mono.just("Hello")
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

Or with async ops:

```java
WebClient.create()
    .get()
    .uri("https://api.example.com/data")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

🧠 **Power-Ups**:
- Fully async, non-blocking
- Integrated into Spring WebFlux
- Error handling with `.onErrorResume()`, `.retry()`
- Supports backpressure (Flux streams)
- Built for high concurrency with low threads
- Composable like Lego bricks 🧱
